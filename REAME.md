Gif Tastic

This webpage will display a list of preset buttons that the user may click on to display ten gifs to the page from the Giphy API. When the gifs are displayed the user may click on the gifs to animate them and with another click can return them back to their paused state. On the right hand side of the page the user will have the option to add another button to the page of gifs that they would like to see. But there is a twist to the button that limits the user in what they may add. 

More styling to the page could be added with color and a background image added. Different themes could be added to not just be Owen Wilson. Removing the buttons altogether to just have the user decide what they want to see. Adding all the bonus features to the assignment.
